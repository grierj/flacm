            <p>
              This design reviews a method for automatically propagating
              configuration changes to servers via a multi-stage pull mechanism.
              This will allow changes to be made once in a central location
              and have the changes propagate at a known regular interval.

            <ul>
              <li><b>Functional Configuration Management</b> - A system that
              provides Functional Configuration Management is a system that
              allows for changes to be made in as few places as possible with
              as little work as possible.  Ideally with the system would allow
              an admin to never have to log into a remote host to make
              configuration changes.
              <li><b>Save Time</b> - Save Time means just that, if something
              saves time it should take less time to do it the time saving
              way then to do it any other way.  Ideally it should be MUCH
              faster to do it the time saving way.
              <li><b>Minimize Admin Intervention</b> - Something that minimizes
              admin failure means that an admin should have to do only those
              jobs that absolutely require a human to do them.  For example if
              a problem can be fixed by restarting a process, the system should
              restart the process on its own.
              <li><b>Modular</b> - A system that is modular means that each
              piece knows what to send to another piece and what it should
              receive from another piece but it shouldn't be tied to that piece
              by language, OS, or anything other then a standardized protocol
              or API.
              <li><b>Language Agnostic</b> - A system that is Language Agnostic
              means that each piece of the system could be written in an
              entirely different language assuming the language can
              functionally perform as that part of the system.  See: 
              <b>Modular</b>
              <li><b>OS Agnostic</b> - The system should run on any system or
              at least as wide a range of systems as possible.  For the scope
              of this design we're concentrating on Unix and Unix-like OSes.
              <li><b>Role Based Controls</b> - Role Based Controls mean the
              system should support arbitrary roles assigned to servers.  Roles
              should be able to be added at any given time to the configuration
              data source without change to the configuration management
              scripts.
              <li><b>Initiation of Configuration Retrieval</b> - This just
              means that the system should have some method of allowing an
              admin to force the box to restart it's configuration process and
              pull the newest binaries/scripts.  This, by it's nature, should
              be an automated process that effects as many servers as necessary
              with one command or one iteration of a series of commands.
              <li><b>Passive Configuration Server</b> - A system with a passive
              server means that clients are not dependent on the server.  They
              should gracefully handle the central server not being available.
              <li><b>Host Overrides</b> - A system with host overrides means
              an individual host can be configured differently then all other
              hosts even though it may belong to a role.  Host overrides can
              and should be limited to one-off configurations and should work
              with role, domain, and OS configurations whenever possible.
              <li><b>Trackable Change</b> - A system with trackable changes
              means there should be some sort of way of seeing what changes
              were added and when.
              <li><b>Reversible Changes</b> - A system with reversible changes
              should allow for new changes to be rolled back to historical old
              changes.  See: <b>Trackable Changes</b>.
              <li><b>Check-in Alerting</b> - A system with Check-In Alerting
              keeps track of the clients that have checked in and if those
              clients stop checking in for a period longer then a configurable
              threshold, it should alert in some manner.  Check-in alerting
              must have some method to disable alerting for a host that has
              been decommissioned or will not be checking in for an extended
              period of time.
              </li>
            </ol>

          <h3><a name="background">Background</a></h3>
            <p>Currently there is no configuration management to speak of for
               our production data center.  Simple things like changing the 
               root password would require an admin to touch dozens of servers
               and manually type "passwd root" on each one.  The same thing
               applies for local accounts, service configuration, software
               repositories, etc.
            <p>Along with the vast amounts of time required to make changes in
               this fashion manual changes open up the possibility of typos and
               servers that don't get updated.  A production environment
               without this sort of configuration management requires and army
               of admins to make changes and clean up the mistakes made during
               those changes.
          <h3><a name="justification">Justification</a></h3>
            <p>The only reasonable competitor in the configuration management
               space we could be expected to use would be <a 
               href="http://www.gnu.org/software/cfengine/cfengine.html">
               cfengine</a>.  Unfortunately cfengine requires an admin team
               to learn a special "policy" language and limits configuration
               management to that policy language.  What we hope to do with
               our configuration management is make a modular language that can
               accept plug-ins from any language from shell to C++ assuming they
               conform to the API.
            <p>So instead of making people become rigidly tied to a special
               language we want to make something that can adapt to the
               infrastructure environment instead of the other way around.  The
               learning curve on a modular setup would be very low, as long as
               a person knew ONE scripting/programming language they'd be able
               to write customized plug-ins.
            <p>In addition to that FLACM will start simple and allow for more
               complicated actions to be performed on an as-needed basis.  An
               admin team could get a useful level of functionality out of a
               base FLACM install by only using flat files with no scripting.
          <h3><a name="design_detail">Design Detail</a></h3>
            <p>The configuration management software will be a multiphase
               setup that takes inspiration from computer boot strapping.
               Each phase will get progressively more complicated until the
               system runs out of phases.  The basic flow of the configuration 
               management software looks like this:<br>
               <img src="config-bootstrap.gif"><br>
            <p>The details of this design can be broken into discussing the
               different phases of the configuration management itself and the 
               toolkit that will be provided with FLACM to help deal with things
               like the bootstrap script deployment and FLACM log monitoring.
            <h4>Bootstrap Phase</h4>
              <p>The bootstrap script is necessarily simple.  The bootstrap
                 code is written in Bourne shell for maximum compatibility.  It
                 will run from init (when available, in cron elsewhere) and
                 kick off a while loop that attempts to download the OS
                 Initialization script from a hard-coded location. Upon failure
                 the while loop tries again. Upon success the OS Initialization
                 phase is run with exec.
              <h5><i>Pseudo-code</i></h5>
                <code><pre>
#!/bin/sh
PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin:/usr/sfw/bin

while (true)
do
  # Linux and New Solaris
  if [ -e /usr/bin/wget || -e /usr/sfw/bin/wget ]
    if [ ! -e /space/flacm ]
      mkdir -p /space/flacm
    elsif [ ! -d /space/flacm ]
      rm -rf /space/flacm
      mkdir -p /space/flacm
    fi
    cd /space/flacm
    wget http://url/to/script
  fi
  if [ $? != 0 ]
    exec /space/flacm/script
  else
    sleep 300
  fi
done
</code></pre>
            <h4>Phase 1 - OS Initialization Phase</h4> 
              <p>The bootstrap code executes the "Phase 1" script which gathers
                 a limited amount of OS data and uses that to determine where
                 to grab either the Environmental Initialization (Phase 2)
                 script or the Configuration/Execution (Phase 3) script.  
              <p>The Phase 1 script contains error checking, unlike or
                 bootstrap code, so that if things fail we can restart the 
                 bootstrap and start over.  Phase 1 must complete successfully
                 for anything to work, so the accuracy of the error checking is
                 vital here. Phase 1 failing should put a lot of verbose logs
                 into /var/log/flacm/phase1.log if it can so the FLACM Log 
                 Checker (see Toolkit) can parse what's going on without
                 an admin having to log into the box.
              <p>There are a variety of checks that can be run in Phase 1
                 determine the base OS.  FLACM will initially parse 
                 /etc/redhat-release since the code will be written primarily
                 for CentOS servers. FLACM should not be checking patch 
                 revisions at this point.  That sort of granularity is pushed
                 back into the Phase 2 script which gathers extended 
                 environment information.
              <p>Once the base OS is determined FLACM should either know how
                 to find a data source that tells it where to get the Phase
                 2 or Phase 3 script.  For the scope of the initial design the
                 location is hard coded into the script with some basic
                 variable swapping to account for different OSes. FLACM then
                 downloads the script and runs it with exec.
            <h4>Phase 2 - Environment Initialization Script</h4>   
              <p>Phase 2 is optional in the work flow for FLACM, but can be
                 useful for widely diverse environments that have many 
                 different OSes or OSes at a wide range of patch/revision 
                 levels.
              <p>Phase 2 is a phase for using OS specific tools to gather as
                 large amounts of OS specific data to either feed to Phase 3
                 or to be used by Phase 2 to accurately point to the correct
                 Phase 3 repository.  
              <p>Examples of where this would be useful would be OSes that have
                 long support lives, like Solaris, but more-or-less manual
                 patching regimes, like Solaris.  Of 30 systems that run
                 Solaris 9 there might be radically different configurations
                 as some systems are running a version of Solaris 9 from 2003
                 and others are patched all the way to 2006.  New directives
                 may have been added to configuration files in that time or
                 old defunct ones may have been taken away.
              <p>Due to these possible oddities FLACM uses a separate Phase 2
                 so that this added complexity can be forgotten all together
                 if an environment doesn't warrant it. Conversely it can be
                 made much more robust if the environment does warrant it.
            <h4>Phase 3 - Configuration and Execution phase</h4>
              <p>Phase 3 is, necessarily, the most complicated portion of 
                 FLACM since the core functionality resides in this phase.
              <p>Phase 3 does a number of tasks.  The first thing it needs to
                 do is determine the Domain and Roles of a system.  The domain
                 is the environment a server is in, such as QA, Production,
                 Development, etc.  The role is the function of the server
                 such as LDAP, DNS, Web, etc.  These two aspects along with the
                 OS should define 95% of an environments configuration changes.
                 The other 5% (or less) should be host specific changes.
              <p>The domain and roles can be derived from a number of sources.
                 The first revision of this project will hold the Roles in
                 a YAML file and the domain will be derived from the FQDN.
                 A roles file might look like:
                 <code><pre>
# Roles
DNS:
  - raptor
  - blackbird 
LDAP:
  - panzer
  - awol
WWW:
  - predator
MYSQL:
  - raptor
KICKSTART:
  - predator
                </code></pre>
              <p>A server may have multiple roles, but admins need to be
                 cautious of conflicts in configuration among roles.  Once the
                 phase 3 script has the OS, Domain, Role and Host information
                 it downloads the necessary configuration files and scripts from
                 the central repository.  The data structure is flat files in
                 a directory hierarchy. An example can be seen below
                 things and 
            <h4>Phase 3 - Data Source Layout</h4>

                 should be two common directories "root" and "scripts".  The
                 "root" directory holds configuration files as they would
                 appear on the file system of the server.  For example,
                 an /etc/password for all CentOS 4.2 servers would be placed
                 in /flacm/OS/CentOS/4.2/root/etc/passwd.  Actually the file
                 would need to be named passwd.whole or passwd.part, these
                 distinctions are examined in <b>Phase 3 - File Extensions</b>.
              <p>The scripts directory holds a number of specifically named
                 scripts that are kicked off at particular times during the
                 configuration process.  These scripts are examined in
                 <b>Phase 3 - Scripts</b>.
            <h4>Phase 3 - File extensions</h4>
              <p>In order to allow for limited scripting, files placed into
                 configuration management must have one of two file
                 extensions.  Files that are the whole configuration file, in
                 that they should completely replace what's already on the
                 system end with a .whole.  Files that should be appended to
                 and existing file should end with .part.  
              <p>A practical example of this would be to have an OS level 
                 /etc/sudoers.whole file that replaced the sudoers file on
                 every box of that OS level with a sudoers that gave access
                 to root and the wheel group (or OS equivalent).  Then the 
                 DOMAIN level would append access (sudoers.part) for the admins
                 of that domain.  The ROLES level would then add access for the
                 operators of each of those roles with another sudoers.part.
                 Finally, if the system hosted some sort of one-off script the
                 HOST level would add sudo access for an operator to run that
                 one-off script just for that host.
              <p>If a directory contains a {file}.whole AND and {file}.part
                 only the {file}.whole will be used and a message to 
                 /var/log/flacm/phase3.log will be recorded.
            <h4>Phase 3 - Scripts</h4>
              <p>Additionally each FLACM subsection contains a "scripts" folder.
                 There are 3 acceptable scripts for each section except roles, 
                 which has 5.  The three main scripts are:
              <ul>
                <li><code>/flacm/.../scripts/pre
                <li><code>/flacm/.../scripts/fix
                <li><code>/flacm/.../scripts/post
              </ul>
              <p>The "pre" script is run after the files are downloaded locally
                 but before any files are copied anywhere else.  The pre script
                 is where FLACM should be used to install RPM dependencies 
                 (from a repository, not FLACM) and basically get the server
                 ready to take the configuration that will be put in place.
              <p>The "fix" script is immediately after the pre script. The "fix"
                 script creates a false root, copies all the files over to it 
                 and chroots into that directory (for example it might run 
                 <code>chroot /falseroot/OS/CentOS/4.2/</code> after copying
                 the files from /flacm/OS/CentOS/4.2/ to that directory. This is
                 the right place to modify permissions.  The point behind this
                 is that many data sources will flatten the permissions on a
                 file to a single user and group and potentially even a single
                 read/write permission setup.  Creating a false root allows
                 permissions to be set up first and then copy the files over.
              <p>The "post" script is run after all files are copied over to
                 the appropriate places.  This script should clean up any
                 temporary files that FLACM created and integrate any new
                 configuration files (like running "newaliases").
              <p>The roles section has two more scripts:
              <ul>
                <li><code>/flacm/.../scripts/install
                <li><code>/flacm/.../scripts/uninstall
              </ul>
              <p>Roles are the most dynamic property of a server.  A server
                 that is an LDAP server will more regularly become a non-LDAP
                 server then it will move out of production or become a
                 different OS.  Because of this, the ability to remove a role
                 is important.  Also, roles are generally more complicated then
                 other types of configuration and there is often tasks that
                 need to be done once, but never again.  For example if LDAP
                 is installed the server no longer needs to point to an
                 external LDAP server, but this only needs to be done once, so
                 it doesn't belong in the "pre" script.
              <p>Each time a server figures out its roles it checks for 
                 /etc/flacm/roles.conf and checks to see if there are any new
                 roles or removed roles.  If there are new roles it runs the
                 install script (after the fix script but before moving any
                 config files).  If there are any removed roles it runs the
                 uninstall script from that role.
            <h4>Phase 3 - Workflow</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Check for .ignore file, if present, do nothing, exit
                    successfully</li>
                <li>Check for .reboot file, if present, download the new
                    version and exec to it.
                <li>Determine roles and domains
                <li>Download OS, Domain, Roles, and Host configs and scripts
                    from FLACM repository.
                <li>Run OS pre
                <li>Run OS fix
                <li>scrub false root, remove any {file}.part if a {file}.whole
                    exists
                <li>copy whole files into place, append part files to existing
                    configs
                <li>Run OS post
                <li>repeat previous 5 steps for Domain, Roles, Host
                <li>During the Roles portion:
                <ol>
                  <li>If there are any removed roles, run uninstall
                  <li>If there are any new roles, run the pre, then fix, 
                      then install
                </ol>
                <li>Check to see if Phase 3 is in cron, schedule if not
                <li>Check to see if there is a /etc/flacm/.reboot file.  Reboot
                    if so.
                <li>Check to see if the reboot time has been reached, Reboot if
                    so.
              </ol>
            <h4>Phase 3 - Misc Requirements</h4>
              <p>The phase 3 script should upgrade itself.  On a regular
                 basis it should check to see if there is a new version of the
                 script and download it if there is.  After a download it
                 should run the new script immediately.
              <p>The phase 3 script should check to see if it's in cron.  If it
                 is not then it should schedule itself.
              <p>The phase 3 script should have a set time that it "reboots"
                 or basically reruns the bootstrap program (in order to get
                 the most current version).  The code should also check for
                 a /etc/flacm/.reboot file and reboot immediately if present.
            <h4>Misc Requirements</h4>
              <p>Starting with Phase 1 all scripts should check for an
                 /etc/flacm/.ignore file.  If present the scripts do nothing.
                 The logic behind this is that if the FLACM central server is
                 down local changes need to be made, FLACM should not overwrite
                 the changes when the server comes back up.  This allows for
                 an extended period of time to get a change put into FLACM.
            <h4>Toolkit</h4>
              <p>The FLACM Toolkit is a collection of scripts that help make
                 FLACM more effective.  At the initial roll out there will be
                 a script to help deploy the bootstrap script to remote
                 machines.
              <p>Other scripts that will be written as time and resources allow
                 are:
              <p><ul>
                <li><b>FLACM Log Checker</b> - A tool to check the remote FLACM
                  logs and return either raw data or an aggregated report.
                </li>
                </ul>
          <h3><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
            <p>
            <ol>
              <li>This is not a YUM replacement!  Do not store RPMs in FLACM.
            </ol>
          <h3><a name="monitoring">Monitoring</a></h3>
            <p>For initial roll out e-mail will be sent.  Moving forward a
               FLACM agent should be written that can be queried about status.
          <h3><a name="roll_out">Roll Out</a></h3>
            <p>FLACM will be rolled out with the initial load test 
               infrastructure at the new data center.  Ideally FLACM will cause
               no downtime for roll out as it lives in userspace.
